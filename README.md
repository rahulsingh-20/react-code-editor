## Syntax Highlighter using React and PrismJS

This assignment is created according to the problem statement mentioned here: https://tealfeedcreatorsprogram.notion.site/Tealfeed-Assignment-05e8fc253f86485ab8311baba37cfde3

It involves 2 components:

- A textarea where the user enters text
- A `Highlight` component which overlaps with the textarea and contains the highlighted code, made using the module `prism-react-renderer`

The `textarea` is made to be invisible, and both the components are synchronised in terms of scrolling horizontally and vertically to make the user feel that the code they are typing is being syntactically highlighted.

Steps to run:

- Clone the directory
- `npm install && npm run dev`
